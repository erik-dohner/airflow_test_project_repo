Where we sit in the upper balcony, things got a little pitchy (that is, flat) in the upper register, especially in the big climaxes. Hopefully that can be corrected by the recording engineers. Many of her pianissimos were quite stunning, but there is little gradation between that and the full-throttle climaxes.",
